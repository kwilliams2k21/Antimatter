Project Requirement
You must implement a robot that can carry out the mission described in the previous section;
however, how this is done will depend on your group's creativity. The only requirements are that
the robot must be able to:
• Semi-autonomously navigate a maze with black 1" to 1.5" thick tape walls. The maze
will also contain obstacles that the robot must avoid. The robot is placed at the maze
entrance (i.e., the mission insertion point discussed in the previous section). Since this
will use behavior-based control, discuss your finite-state machine designs in your
presentation and include them in your deliverable.
• Use the line sensors to stay within the maze, obstacle sensors to avoid obstacles, and the
camera to find MoOb and the sample. The MoOb will be a green object in color, and the
sample will be red.
• Send images and receive commands remotely. You will need to design the architecture
for such a system. You also need to develop the protocol and implement the API to allow
your team to receive and display images from the robot and send commands back to the robot
